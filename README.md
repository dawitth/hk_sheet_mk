Housekeeping sheet maker

Intro:

The house keeping department at HOJO has different system for cleaning rooms. Room service is determined by the number of nights stayed at the hotel, the length of stay(long term or short term stay), and the date (Special service for long term stay on Tuesday and Friday).  A service, B service and C service are the three types of service given for the rooms. Any guest staying for the first night gets A service. For long term stays, on Tuesday and Friday, they get B service and C service for the all other days. For shot term stays, every third night stay they get A service. Otherwise, they get C service. 

Problem defination:

Every night, the night audit spends half hour(depending on expertise) to finish making the sheet. It is difficult and takes long time to train a new audit to make the sheet. When mistake is made, the guest gets the wrong type of service which resulting complaint. 

Usage:

The user is asked to locate the stay over list(PDF) and arrival list(PDF). And also, the date for which the sheet needs to be made. Once the users selects to process the data, the output is generated in xlsx file.
